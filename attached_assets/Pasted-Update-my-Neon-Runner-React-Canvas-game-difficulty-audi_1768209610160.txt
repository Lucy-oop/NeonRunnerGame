Update my Neon Runner (React + Canvas) game difficulty + audio.

GOAL 1 — Speed schedule (discrete steps):
- The game has a variable "speedRate" (or equivalent movement speed multiplier).
- At the moment the run starts, set speedRate = 0.5
- After 10 seconds of play time, speedRate = 1.0
- After 20 seconds, speedRate = 1.5
- After 30 seconds, speedRate = 2.0
- After 40 seconds, speedRate = 2.5
- After 50 seconds, speedRate = 3.0
- After 60 seconds, speedRate = 3.5
- After 70 seconds, speedRate = 4.0
- After 80 seconds, speedRate = 4.5
- After 90 seconds and beyond, speedRate = 5.0 (MAX CAP, never exceed 5)

Implementation details:
- Track elapsed play time in seconds (only while game is in PLAYING state; pause/reset should not keep increasing time).
- Compute step index: step = floor(elapsedSeconds / 10)
- speedRate = min(0.5 + 0.5 * step, 5)
- Apply speedRate to obstacle movement and background scrolling.
- Also optionally apply a mild ramp to obstacle spawn rate so early game is easy:
  - Start spawn interval around 1400–1600ms
  - Every 10 seconds reduce interval by ~80–120ms
  - Minimum spawn interval cap around 600–700ms

GOAL 2 — Sound effects + background music:
Add simple audio using Web Audio or HTMLAudio (no external libraries needed).

Sound effects (SFX):
- Jump sound (on jump)
- Double jump sound (on double jump) OR same jump sound is OK
- Hit/death sound (on collision / game over)
- UI click sound (Start Game and Restart)

Background music (BGM):
- Looping background music during gameplay
- Volume low (e.g., 0.2–0.35)
- Provide a mute/unmute toggle button (top right) that controls both SFX and BGM.
- Autoplay restrictions: on first user interaction (Start Game click/tap), unlock audio and start BGM.

Assets:
- If project already has audio files, use them.
- If not, add small placeholder audio files or use free assets and place them in the public/static assets folder.
- Make sure paths work with Vite/React build.

Deliverables:
- Tell me exactly which files you changed (e.g., client/src/Game.ts, App.tsx, styles).
- Show the variables/constants for:
  - speedRate schedule
  - spawn interval schedule
  - max caps
  - audio volume levels
- Confirm Start Game remains clickable and audio starts only after user interaction.
