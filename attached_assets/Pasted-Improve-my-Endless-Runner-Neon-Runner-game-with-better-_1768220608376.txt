Improve my Endless Runner (Neon Runner) game with better UI, and MOST IMPORTANTLY: audio (background music + cute sound effects).

🚨🚨🚨 TOP PRIORITY: AUDIO MUST FEEL COMFORTABLE + CUTE 🚨🚨🚨
- The audio is the main feature I want improved.
- Background music should be calm, cozy, and low volume.
- Sound effects should be cute and soft (no harsh or loud SFX).
- Add a clear audio UI (mute toggle + volume sliders if possible).

====================
1) UI / LAYOUT FIXES (High score hiding + Start button not clickable)
====================
Problems:
- High score UI overlaps / hides content.
- Start Game button becomes unclickable sometimes due to overlay layers.

Fix:
- Redesign start screen and game over screen:
  - Put HIGH SCORES inside its own separate card/panel that does NOT cover the button.
  - Add spacing/padding and max-height with scroll if needed (overflow-y:auto).
  - Ensure Start Game and Restart are ALWAYS clickable on desktop and mobile.
  - Fix layering:
    - Background / decorative overlays MUST have `pointer-events: none`
    - Interactive UI (buttons) MUST be on top with higher z-index
- Make it look more comfortable:
  - More whitespace
  - Softer glow
  - Rounded panels
  - Clear hierarchy: Title → Best Score → Buttons → High Scores
- Fully responsive mobile layout.

====================
2) ⭐⭐⭐ AUDIO: COMFORT BACKGROUND MUSIC + CUTE SOUND EFFECTS ⭐⭐⭐
====================

------------------------------------
A) BACKGROUND MUSIC (BGM) — BIG FOCUS
------------------------------------
Requirements:
- Add looping background music with a cozy vibe:
  - chill / soft synth / lo-fi arcade / warm ambient
  - NOT intense, NOT fast, NOT aggressive
- Volume should be LOW and comfortable:
  - default BGM volume: 0.20 to 0.30
- Audio must follow game states:
  - Start Game click/tap → unlock audio + start BGM
  - While PLAYING → BGM continues
  - Game Over → BGM stops or fades out smoothly
  - Restart → BGM restarts (or resumes)
- Must handle browser autoplay rules:
  - BGM must NOT attempt to play until user clicks/taps Start Game.
- Add smooth fade in/out:
  - Fade in over ~800ms when game starts
  - Fade out over ~600ms on Game Over

------------------------------------
B) SOUND EFFECTS (SFX) — CUTE + SOFT
------------------------------------
Add these SFX (cute and gentle):
- Button click: soft “tick”
- Jump: soft “boop”
- Double jump: slightly higher pitch “boop”
- Collectible pickup: cute sparkle/chime
- Power-up pickup: soft “whoosh”
- Game over: gentle “oops” / low pop (NOT harsh)

SFX rules:
- Default SFX volume: 0.35 to 0.55 (still not loud)
- No distortion or sharp high frequencies
- If multiple SFX trigger quickly, prevent clipping (limit overlapping / throttle)

------------------------------------
C) AUDIO CONTROLS UI (VERY IMPORTANT)
------------------------------------
- Add a visible mute/unmute button (top right).
- Mute must control BOTH BGM and SFX.
- (Optional but preferred) Add small sliders:
  - Music volume slider
  - SFX volume slider
- Save audio settings to localStorage:
  - mute state
  - music volume
  - sfx volume

Assets:
- If audio files do not exist:
  - add small placeholder files in public/assets/audio
  - OR pick free assets and add them to the repo
- Ensure paths work with Vite/React build.

====================
3) CORE MOVEMENT & DIFFICULTY
====================
Core:
- Auto-run always on.
- Player controls actions only (jump / double jump etc.)

Difficulty:
- Speed increases gradually (no sudden jumps)
- Cap max speed so it’s always playable
- Keep early game easy and slow

Procedural generation:
- Use reusable chunks
- Avoid impossible obstacle combos
- Early spacing generous

====================
4) ACTIONS & OBSTACLES
====================
Player actions:
- Jump
- Double jump
- Duck/slide (only if already implemented)
- Side shift (only if already implemented)

Obstacles:
- Mostly static, readable
- Some slow moving obstacles later
- Collision = Game Over (unless shield active)

====================
5) REWARDS & POWER-UPS
====================
Collectibles:
- Coins/gems
- Clear visual feedback + SFX

Power-ups:
- Magnet: pulls collectibles
- Shield: blocks ONE hit
- Multiplier: score boost temporarily
Rules:
- Rare
- Clearly visible
- One active at a time

====================
6) PROGRESSION & FEEDBACK
====================
Scoring:
- Distance survived = main score
- Collectibles = bonus
- Show current score clearly during gameplay
- Show BEST score on start & game over

Game Over screen:
- Final score, best score, restart button
- Calm animation (fade/scale)

====================
7) FINAL DELIVERABLE
====================
After changes:
- List files modified
- List constants:
  - base speed / speed ramp / max speed
  - BGM volume, SFX volume
- Confirm:
  - High score never hides buttons
  - Start Game always clickable
  - Audio starts only after Start click/tap
  - BGM + SFX sound comfortable and cute
